"""The five routes, their definitions, and the two prompts. TODO 1 and 4.

Write the definitions before you write any code. This is not a style
preference, it is the difference between a measurement and a coincidence.

If the boundary between a status chase and a request is not written down
before the prompt is written, then your prompt and the gold labels disagree
in a way neither of you has noticed, and the accuracy number you produce is
measuring the gap between your definitions and ours rather than the quality
of your classifier. You will not be able to tell those two apart afterwards.

# message feels like. "The sender is annoyed" is not a route: a request can
# be furious and a complaint can be perfectly polite. Tone is a property of

# `other` still needs a real definition even though it means "everything
# else". A route defined only by exclusion is where a classifier hides its
# failures, and you will not find them at the checkpoint.

# You may disagree with the definitions in queries.py. If you do, that is a
# legitimate choice and it has a consequence: your accuracy is then measured
# against labels produced under a different convention. Decide deliberately
# and write the decision in DECISIONS.md.

"""TODO 4: write the single hedging prompt that the router has to beat.

Make it a fair fight. A deliberately bad monolith proves nothing, and the
checkpoint will ask you whether yours was fair. It should know about all
five kinds of message and be asked to do the right thing for each. What it
cannot do is specialize, because one instruction has to serve five jobs.

If your router does not beat this, that is a real result and it is the one
to report. On twenty four queries with a capable model, a well written
hedging prompt often holds its own, and a student who says so and ships the
simpler system has demonstrated the judgment the project rubric rewards."""
